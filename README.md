# Django i18n Sample

Sample app to test Django i18n features, that includes:

- Internationalization of manues in the navbar
- URL handling with selected language prefix
- Translation of page content based on selected language (`django-modeltranslate`)
- Language switching using Django's built in `set_language` view

Happy coding!
